# remux-script

A script that remuxes .mkv files to .mp4 files using ffmpeg.

## Requirements

-   [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)
    -   Get the Windows executable from one ofthe two mirrors. The executable can either by placed in the `C:\Windows\System32` or added as an evironment variable (Path section).
        -   New environment variables may require a restart before they work.
-   [Quicktime](https://support.apple.com/kb/dl837?locale=en_US) [OPTIONAL]
    -   In order to encode using the ProRes codec (if the user chooses to do so), download and install Quicktime.

## Usage

Firstly, ensure that ffmpeg is installed; on windows, open the terminal (powershell or cmd) and use the command `ffmpeg`. The output should give version and copyright information followed by various flags. Secondly, download the source code, and move the `remux.bat` file to a directory that contains the files you want to remux (optionally, you can keep the batch file in it's own directory and drag files into the directory or over top the batchfile). On the first launch the `remux.bat` file will create a config file named `conf.ini` (Please see the next section to understand the config file). After runningthe script successully, you should be greeted with a

## Config file

From the first release (0.1.0) onwrads, the script will utilize a `conf.ini` file. This will not be included inthe github repository or release packages, but instead will be auto-generated by the script. The template generated by the script will be :

```ini
[MAIN]
CRF=0
PRESET=8
TUNE=1
CONV_COLORSPACE=0
CONV_PRORES=0
CONV_AVI=0
```

A small part of the documentation will be dedicated to using and understanding these settings, but for now please visit this [website](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Encode/H.264).

Code heavily inspired by [gmzorz's prorec script.](https://github.com/gmzorz/prerecs)

## Author Notes:

-   The -crf value is set to 0 which normally means lossless, so it may be extremely slow depending on file specifics.
-   The tune is specifically set for animtion, so the output will have higher deblocking than normal to keep things looking smooth
-   The preset is set to veryslow which prioritizes conserving the bitrate.
-   The script assumes that the original .mkv file is in a codec that the .mp4 container supports.
-   Latest version dropped -ar flag which specifies audio sampling frequency. (This is kept the same as the input file)
